by Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok
Arrange whatever offering tormas you have and recite the following:
ram yam kham om ah hung
Raṃ yaṃ khaṃ. Oṃ āḥ hūṃ.
torma khadok dri ro nü chü den
This torma is colourful and has a nourishing scent and flavour,
zakmé yeshe kyepé damdzé di
It is a samaya substance for generating immaculate wisdom.
gyalwang tamché khyenpé chen nga ru
When, in the presence of the all-knowing lord of the victorious ones,1
gul khuk lé jung dorjé purba yi
This powerful and most profound maṇḍala
yangzab kyilkhor nyenpo shyal ché tsé
Of the Neck-Pouch Arisen Vajrakīla was first opened,
tenpa sung shying tendzin kyongwa yi
You vowed to carry out all the activities
trinlé tadak drubpar khelangpé
Of guarding these teachings and sustaining those who uphold them:
dorjé drakden khor dangché la bul
Dorje Drakden, together with your retinue, I offer this to you!
yardam nyenpo chö kyi ying su sé
Let your forceful pledge merge with the dharmadhātu
dak gi yi la mönpé dön dré kün
And cause all that we wish for
ma tok data nyi du minpar dzö
To ripen unimpededly, here and now!
Thus, as Abhaya spoke these words on the 28th day of the fifth month, Khenpo Sodargye committed
them to writing. May there be virtue!
