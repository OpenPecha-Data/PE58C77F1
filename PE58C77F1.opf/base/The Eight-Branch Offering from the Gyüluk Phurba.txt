↑ Jigme Lingpa explains these as the four extremes of existence and non-existence, eternalism
and annihilationism.↑ Jigme Lingpa explains that the sugatas referred to here are the buddhas
of the past; the mighty lords are the gurus, the buddhas of the present; and sentient
beings are the buddhas of the future, since they all possess the buddha-nature or sugatagarbha.↑
As Jigme Lingpa explains, one offers to the buddhas of the past in order to bring
about the actualization of their inexhaustible qualities of the body, speech, mind, qualities
and activities; one offers to the buddhas of the present in order to become a suitable
vessel for the perfect wisdom of all the tathāgatas and to attain fruition through their
empowerment and blessings; and one offers to the buddhas of the future in order to create
the auspicious circumstances for attaining the fruition of the great vehicle and fully perfecting
the benefit of others.
