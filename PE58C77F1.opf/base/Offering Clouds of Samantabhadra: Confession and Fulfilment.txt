The Confession and Fulfilment Practice Entitled 'Offering Clouds of Samantabhadra', Part of
the 'Neck-Pouch Dagger’ (Purba Gulkhukma) Cycle
by Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok

hung, dak nyam detong ngang lé rangsharwé
Hūṃ! Naturally arisen out of the state of bliss-emptiness, purity and equalness,
nangsi shyir shyeng kunzang chöpé trin
Appearance and existence as the manifest ground, the offering clouds of Samantabhadra—
chi nang sangwa yangsang dé khoné
Outer, inner, secret and innermost secret reality itself—
nam mang köpé khyepar künné dzok
With all this, perfect in every way, arranged with many features,
rabjam shying kün khyabpar dalwa di
And fully pervading throughout all infinite realms,
palchen dorjé shyonnü tukdam kang
May the wishes of the great, glorious Vajrakumāra be fulfilled!
dangpö lechen dribpé narwa dak
I, a beginner tormented by obscurations,
ma shé ma gü bakmé nyönmong kyi
Have, in my ignorance and through lack of respect, carelessness and mental affliction,
da ka dorjé tatsik lé depé
Transgressed the solemn vajra oath that is difficult to contravene,
galtrul tadak nying né tol shying shak
I acknowledge and confess all such errors and confusion from the depths of my heart!
dribmé tsangpa chok gi ngödrub tsol
Please grant the supreme accomplishment of unobscured purity!
mitün kyen ngen ying su shyiwa dang
Pacify unfavourable circumstances and adversity into absolute space,
tünkyen tadak yar ngö da shyin pel
Cause favourable circumstances to increase just like the waxing moon,
sampa lhün gyi drubpar jingyi lob
And grant your blessings so that all our wishes may be spontaneously fulfilled!

This arose spontaneously out of the expanse of awareness while I was in my room at Tekchen Namdrolling,
the great centre of Ngagyur Nyingma teachings, at dawn on the 28th day of the
sixth month in the Iron Horse year of the seventeenth calendrical cycle (1990); it was transcribed
by the diligent observer of precepts and upholder of the Tripiṭaka Khenpo Sodargye.
May virtue and goodness increase!
