In accordance with the request of Rigdzin Jigme Phuntsok Jungne, the incarnation of the emanated
treasure-revealer Lerab Lingpa, who said that he needed a lineage prayer for his pure
vision, the Neck Pouch Vajrakīla, I, Tendzin Gyatso, a bhikṣu follower of Śākyamuni, who
has a connection through karma and aspirations, wrote this on the first day of the sixth month
of the Iron Horse year (23 July 1990). May virtue and goodness increase!
