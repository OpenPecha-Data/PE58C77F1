Short Vajrakīla Dokpa
by the Fifth Dalai Lama

hung, shyi ying gyurmé chökü long yang né
Hūṃ! Out of the unchanging space of the ground, dharmakāya's vast expanse,
tsalnang gakmé dorjé purpé lha
You manifest unimpededly as its dynamic power, deities of Kīla—
yingrik yermé torma di shyé la
Please accept this torma of indivisible space and rigpa,
trulnang ne dön dra gek ying su dok
And dispel all delusory appearances, sickness, harmful influences, enemies and obstructing forces
into all-pervading space!

This was composed by the monk from the Zahor family.
